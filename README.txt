Welcome to my chat program

USAGE: First run the server.py next then run client.py. Its that simple

To exit from the chat, one ethier server or the client should say "bye" and after repley
the chat program exits... :) :) :)

This is a program I build considering netcat. Build my program doesn't have much features as nc (like -e option my favorite).
But I can do say that you can use this program to chat between a server and a client.  

Hope you Enjoy
